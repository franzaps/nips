Applications
------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines kind 32267 to represent a software application.

The description and visuals of an application are optionally provided via a linked [NIP-54](54.md) kind 30818 wiki article.

## Application

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 32267,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<app-id>"], // Usually reverse domain notation: com.example.app
    ["name", "<human-readable project name>"], // Name, in case wiki article is missing
    ["repository", "<repo-url>"], // Source code repository URL: https://github.com/example/android
    ["commit-id", "<sha1-commit-id>"], // SHA1 commit id used to build the release
    ["a", "30818:<destination-pubkey>:<app-slug>", "<relay-url>"], // Pointer to NIP-54 wiki article
    ["a", "30617:<destination-pubkey>:<repo-id>", "<relay-url>"], // Pointer to NIP-34 repository
    ["license", "<spdx-id>"] // License ID from https://spdx.org/licenses/: Apache-2.0
  ]
}
```

All tags are optional except for `d`. Android applications MUST use the application identifier as the `d` tag.

The `content` field SHOULD be empty.

Clients SHOULD first check for the availability of the linked kind 30818 to retrieve the app description and display information contained in tags including `title`, `summary`, `image`, `icon`, `url`, `t`, etc.

### Attribution

App authors MAY include their pubkeys as `p` tags and `zap` tags as per [NIP-57 - Appendix G](57.md). This is useful in the case of an author other than the one who signed the event, or multiple authors.

## Usage

A kind 30063 [release artifact set](51.md) SHOULD have an `"a"` tag reference to this event, alongside its references to `"e"` [file metadata](94.md) events.
